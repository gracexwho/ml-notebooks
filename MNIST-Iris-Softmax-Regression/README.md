This project compares the performance of two classifiers, softmax regression and K-Nearest-Neighbour(KNN), by evaluating them on 2 datasets. The Digits dataset from Scikit-Learn is made up of images of hand-written digits, and the MFeat-morphological dataset consists of handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch utility maps. We used Gradient Descent to optimize the models and selected the best hyper-parameters via 5-fold cross-validation and GridSearch. Moreover, we explored how the running time and accuracy of the models would change as we tuned the hyper-parameters.  Our initial results were very promising, showing that KNN Classifier has a slightly better performance than Softmax Regression. Using our KNN Classifier, we achieved an accuracy of 98.54% on the Digits dataset and an accuracy of 72.19% on the MFeat-morphological dataset.
