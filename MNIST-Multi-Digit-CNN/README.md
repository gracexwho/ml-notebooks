This  mini-project  addresses  the  task  of  image  classification  using  a  modified  version  of  theMNIST  database  of  handwritten  digits.   The  modified  MNIST  dataset  consists  of  images  thatcontain at most five digits, in the range of 0 to 9, superimposed onto a patterned background.  Thisproject involves the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning method,to perform image classification and handwritten digit recognition.After searching for pre-existing work and image classification libraries, we found several relatedapproaches to create a pipeline to solve our problem. The one approach that proved the most fruitfulis based on the end-to-end Deep CNN model proposed by [1].  The authors proposed an end-to-end Tensorflow solution to this problem that does not involve breaking down the problem into thecomplicated steps of localization, segmentation, and recognition.  Inspired by the great results theydisplayed in their study and their model that could correctly classify multi-digit MNIST imageswithout the assistance of a digit localizer, we adapted their work for this project.When we first evaluated our model on the synthetic multi-digit MNIST dataset, we obtainedan accuracy of 80%.  After applying data processing and hyperparameter tuning to our model, weeventually achieved a 98.00% accuracy on the test dataset of the Kaggle competition.
